Traffix is a traffic light simulation project developed using Python's Pygame library. The simulation dynamically adjusts traffic light signals based on the number of vehicles in each lane, providing a more realistic and efficient traffic management system.

**Features**

1)Dynamic Traffic Lights: Traffic signals turn green or red based on the real-time vehicle count in each lane.

2)Vehicle Simulation: Randomly generated vehicles move through the lanes, simulating real-world traffic.

**Configurable Parameters:** 

1)Adjust the minimum vehicle threshold, maximum and minimum signal durations to fine-tune the simulation.

2)Two-Lane System: The simulation currently supports two lanes of traffic with separate signals.

3)Multi-threading: Efficient management of vehicle movement and signal timing using multi-threading.



**Installation**

To run the Traffix simulation, ensure you have Python 3.x and Pygame installed. Once the dependencies are set up, you can run the simulation by executing the main Python file.

**Usage**

1) The simulation will automatically start with vehicles moving through the lanes.

2) Traffic lights will adjust their timing based on the vehicle count in each lane.
 
3) You can observe how the green light duration changes depending on traffic density.



   
**Configuration**

You can customize the simulation by editing the configuration parameters in the main Python file, including the default, maximum, and minimum green light durations, as well as the vehicle threshold for adjusting these timings.
